# Additional options that are passed to the Daemon.

# sane default: route between local KNX clients and multicast
#DAEMON_ARGS="-e 0.0.1 -E 0.0.2:8 -u /tmp/eib -u /var/run/knx -i -b ip:"
#
# set to just read new knxd.ini config file instead of parsing long command lines...
DAEMON_ARGS="/etc/knxd.ini"

# The default options are "-e 0.0.1 -E 0.0.2:8 -u /tmp/eib -b ip:"
# which tell knxd to route between all of
#  /tmp/eib (legacy socket (-u))
#  multicast client (-b ip:).
# knxd's own bus address is 0.0.1; it will assign 0.0.2…0.0.9 to clients.
# The knxd.socket file also tells knxd to listen to
#  /run/eib (socket activation via systemd)
#  TCP port 6720 (socket activation via systemd)

# You *need* the -e option. Clients cannot connect without "-E".
# *** DO NOT use "-u" / "-u /run/knx" or "-i" / "-i 6720" here.
# Systemd already does that on behalf of knxd, via 'knx.socket'.

# DO NOT use "-RS" and "-b ip:" at the same time (unless you specify a
# different multicast address on one of them). You'd create a loop.

# If you have KNX hardware on a serial port or USB, add the appropriate
# "-b TYPE:…" option. In this case, you probably want to set up a multicast
# server, not a client (i.e. use "-D -T -R -S", not "-b ip:").
# DO NOT use both.
#
# If your KNX hardware is a KNX/IP gateway that doesn't do multicast,
# use "-b ipt:192.168.1.2" (or its DNS name) to talk to it.
#
# KNX MUST NOT have more than one path between any two devices. Thus,
# you need to make sure that the KNX/IP gateway does not route multicast
# before you use both "-S" and "-b ipt:".

# The default bus address of knxd is 0.0.1. If that's in use in your KNX
# network (or if you run more than one knxd on your network), set a
# different address (-e 15.0.99).


# Run `knxd --help` to get a complete list of available options and drivers.

## DO NOT use the following options:
## -d           -- /etc/rc.d/knxd aleady does that for us
## -p PIDFILE   -- /etc/rc.d/knxd aleady does that for us
